			<p>Into the unknown<br>
		      Into the unknown<br>
		      Into the unknown<br>
		      I can hear you but I won't<br>
		      Some look for trouble while others don't<br>
		      There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day<br>
		      And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh<br>
		      Whoa<br>
		      You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear<br>
		      And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for I fear<br>
		      Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls<br>
		      I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls<br>
		      I've had my adventure, I don't need something new<br>
		      I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you<br>
		      4Into the unknown<br>
		      Into the unknown<br>
		      4Into the unknown<br>
		      (Oh)<br>
		      (Oh)<br>
		      What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake<br>
		      Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?<br>
		      Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like<br><br><br>

			  The following word cloud shows the words from the song "Into the unknown". I made this for a data structures class at Brooklyn College.<br><br>
			  It was generated by finding the most frequent words using a HashMap.The code was written in Java. I chose this data structure since it is easy to identify the value and key. I can associate a key with a value directly. It is efficient for locating a value based on its key and adding and removing th values based on the key. Thus, it is useful to count the occurrence of the string and record the frequency of each word.<br><br>
			  Then, I selected this particular data visualization technique because it would be more attractive and interesting, the human brain tends to process visual information far more easily than the written information.<br><br>
			  If I had more time to work on this project, I want to adjust my website apperance, the size of the pictures and the color of the font are not perfect.<br><br>
			  The song that I chose is named "Into the Unknown". I selected this song since I love this song so much, it is a song recorded by Idina Menzel and Aurora from Disney film "Frozen 2" in 2019. The melody is very beautiful. This song was on the billboard top hit in these days, "Frozen 2" soundtrack tops the billboard albums chart.<br><br>
			  I can find the value of each word by using the HashMap. The top words in the lyrics "Into the Unknown" are "I", "unknown", "into" and "the".It wasn't surprised me since it is the title of the song and it appears many time, from the beginning, these words have already emerged three times.
